	<td>My father's name is Adnan Bin Othman. He's 45 years old. My father works as a welder. He is a cat lover because he has six cats at home. My mother's name is Azlida Binti Abd Rahman. She's 44 years old. My mother has been a full-time housewife since she got married to my father.
I am the eldest among my siblings. My little sister, Nur Ellyssa Fazrin, She's 18 years old. Both of my parents have dedicated their lives to raising the two of us and ensuring that we become successful individuals in this world and the hereafter. I thank God for such great parents.</td>
